URL :

1. Any number of URLs are allowed in the Chat Message.
2. There is no length restrictions for URL.
3. Assumption is that, most realtime URLs either start with http:// or https:// or
   bitly shortened links ( ex: http://bit.ly/1x2qpLW)
4. A set of characters will be treated as URL till a whitespace is reached.
   Example:
   Valid Input : "@Ramki (Smiley) How are you?? Weather is (awesome)
                  Did you check @Adam's blog http://bit.ly/1x2qpLW and http://bit.ly/1xsadasd"

   ###########  Formatted JSON ############ {
    "emoticons": [
        "Smiley"
    ],
    "mentions": [
        "Ramki"
    ],
    "url": [
        "http://bit.ly/1x2qpLW",
        "http://bit.ly/1xsadasd"
    ]
}

   Invalid I/p:  @Ramki (Smiley) How are you?? Did you check http://msn.com?&id=1&page=4http://bit.ly/1xsadas
   (Here both URLs are seperated by commas which will be treated as a single URL and it is not expected. This is
   designed to cater the real-time needs that no 2 URLs will be continuous, there would be a whitespace.

5. Any URL which cannot be reached will not appear in the final output.
   Ex :  No connection adapters were found for 'ftp://ftp6.jp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/'

Emoticons:

Assumption : Emoticons, Mentions will be mentioned only once in the final json,
             even they occured(repeated) more than once in the input string.
Reason     : @Ramki1988 can be only a specific person.
             May be in future if there is a need to remove this condition, then it will be taken care.
